## Static

Static layouts are the traditional web: one design that sits in the center of the page and requires horizontal scrolling if the window is too small for it. M dot sites *(m. site is a website that's specifically designed for mobile devices, and exists on a separate subdomain)* are the traditional answer to this, providing a wholly separate site for a lower resolution - and all the work of creating a separate site.

## Liquid

Liquid (also called "Fluid") is characterized by scaling the width of parts of the design relative to the window. It tends to fail when the window is much smaller or much larger than it was originally designed for.

## Adaptive

Adaptive is characterized by having defined layouts for different resolutions. Within each layout, resizing the window does not change the layout.

You can think of Adaptive as a series of Static layouts.

## Responsive

Responsive is characterized by having defined layouts for different resolutions. Within each layout, the design is liquid and resizes the width of elements relative to the changing window size.

You can think of Responsive as a series of Liquid layouts.
